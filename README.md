# Stroke Prediction

### FALL 2024 GWU **__DATS6103__** STROKE PREDICTION DATSET

This project aims to analyze the relationship between demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors and the likelihood of stroke occurrence. By utilizing the "Stroke Prediction Dataset," this study seeks to identify key predictors of stroke and assess their significance, enabling insights that could aid in early intervention and health risk management.

### **Key Questions Explored:**

1) **What are the key factors most strongly associated with the occurrence of strokes?**

2) **How does each predictor's distribution differ between different stroke cases ?**

3) **Can we determine statistically significant correlations or patterns in stroke occurrence based on categorical variables?**

4) **Can we identify trends or variations in stroke risk based on time-related factors like age?**

5) **How accurate is it on building a machine learning model predict stroke occurrence based on the dataset?**

These questions will guide our analysis, helping us understand the key factors and behaviors for stroke prediction.
